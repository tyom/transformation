        <ul>
          <li>measure how you use the website so it can be updated and improved based on your needs</li>

        <h3>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h3>

        <p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use NHS.UK. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its users and to help us make improvements, eg improving site search.</p>

        <p>Google Analytics stores information about:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>the pages you visit on NHS.UK</li>
          <li>how long you spend on each NHS.UK page</li>
          <li>how you got to the site</li>
          <li>what you click on while you’re visiting the site</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We don’t collect or store your personal information (eg your name or address) so this information can’t be used to identify who you are.</p>

        <div role="note" aria-label="Information">
          <p>We don’t allow Google to use or share our analytics data.</p>

        <p>Google Analytics sets the following cookies:</p>
